This is a project management tool (trello clone of sorts), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Developing

### Running development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev

# or

npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deployment

**UPDATE**: This project is long abandoned. No working deployment exists, since Heroku committed Seppuku (REST API disconnected).
